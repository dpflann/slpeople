# Introduction

This repo contains a solution to the SalesLoft offline exerise (v2).

# Architecture

In deciding how to solve this, I decided to choose two technologies
that were new to me:

- Vue.js for the front-end.
- The Chi project which uses Go for the back-end.

*NB*: It is entirely possible that these choices will change during the course of development. ;)
